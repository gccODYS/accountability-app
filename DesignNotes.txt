## Elevator Idea (1-3 sentences that articulates concept)


An app that helps people hit their goals by gamifying their planning and habit tracking. The app guides the user the process of setting goals and making plans, and motivates them to stay consistent through leveling up their "avatar." An AI asks the user questions like "what prevented you from hitting your habits?" and "what can you do to make sure you complete your habit tomorrow?"


(Lean more into AI side with mantras and reminders?)
