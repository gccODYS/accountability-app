I want to create a journaling app that is powered by AI. It must have the following functionality:

- The user needs to be able to create journals.
- Journals should be stored somewhere where the user can look back on previous journals
- Journals should somehow be stored in the AI's memory.
- AI should respond to user journal entries based off context and knowledge from other journals
